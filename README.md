Airbnb is recognized as one of the most lucrative and renowned companies in the world, where millions of hosts rent out their property to travelers. Travelers from all over the world book a rental listing via Airbnb's website in accordance to travelers plan. As a past user that used Airbnb in 2018 when looking for a rental unit for a month, I lucked out and found a quaint studio Airbnb listing that was close to transportation, was spacious, and was close to my work place. After talking with the Airbnb host via phone, I felt at ease with Airbnb's rules and regulations in regards to safety measures. I wanted to divulge further in Airbnb's analysis for 2021 and wanted to seek whether listing prices correlate to NYC borough. As a born and raised 'New Yorker,' confirming various hypothesis such as whether travelers will book with a host who has a profile picture or verified is my goal for this case study. 

Questions to be answered in Case Study: 

What is the average price of an Airbnb listing?
Which type of rental properties gets most booked?
Which neighborhood do customers book more often?
How many individuals can an Airbnb property occupy?
Do reviews affect listing price?
